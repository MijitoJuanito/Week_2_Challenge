                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, My name is Juan De La Cruz. I am an aspiring software and web devolper hoping this webpage showcases my skills and projects that I have 
                    worked on throughout my time at the UCLA Coding Bootcamp. A little bit about myself that I can share is that I am really interested in Pokemon,
                    fashion(clothing brands and shoes), music(any genre to be exact), and video games. When it comes to Pokemon it was one of the first games I grew 
                    up with along with watching the animated show. Throughout my years of growing Pokemon was always with me and stuck by my side which bring me to my 
                    favorite Pokemon who is Totodile. When it comes to fashion I love looking into different outfits and different styles of many kinds of people and 
                    just love the way how each piece if put together wheather it be by color, material, theme, or even pieces that are created by scratch. I would say 
                    my love for fashion grew when I purchased my first shoe which happens to be the Air Jordan 1 Mochas that so happens is my favorite shoe but also started
                    my collection of shoes. Music is something I am always listening to for any daily task or even for pure enjoyment because it just lightens my mood and makes
                    me feel like I am in my own space where I won't be bothered. I play video games when I have some free time but the games I am currently playing is Valorant,
                    Rainbow 6 Seige, Fortnite, Overwatch, Pokemon, and single player games.  </p>
